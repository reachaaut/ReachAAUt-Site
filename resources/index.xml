      <description>Writing an academic blog post is a great way to disseminate your research and expand your network even more. A blog enables you to access new audiences outside your close peer-community â€“ for instance businesses and policy makers. Like other digital academic engagement, publishing a blog will not necessarily translate into more citations for your publications but it may increase attention on your work among practitioners and may even land you invites to give keynotes or to act as a consultant outside academia.</description>

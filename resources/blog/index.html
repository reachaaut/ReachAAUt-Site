        <div class="content"><p>Writing an academic blog post is a great way to disseminate your research and expand your network even more. A blog enables you to access new audiences outside your close peer-community – for instance businesses and policy makers. Like other digital academic engagement, publishing a blog will not necessarily translate into more citations for your publications but it may increase attention on your work among practitioners and may even land you invites to give keynotes or to act as a consultant outside academia.</p>
<p>Blogs are still one of the formats on the Internet that allow for long-form content and deeper discussions. At the same time they offer you a great way to communicate your research broader without having to deal with copyright issues, getting professional equipment or investing lots of time.</p>
<h1 id="the-general">The general:</h1>
<p>Below we compiled suggestions found in literature, in online communities on research dissemination as well as in the interviews conducted in this project.</p>

<h5 id="1-what-to-write-write-about-the-things-you-do-or-have-done--or-just-convert-your-recent-publication-into-a-post">1. What to write: Write about the things you do or have done – or just convert your recent publication into a post!</h5>
<p>Your blog is not a research article. You can write about research ideas that are not ready, yet. You can write about the experiments that failed. The fact that it is a blog and not a research article allows you to write about all of your work. Another very common approach just uses the format to present short summaries (executive summaries) of your work. You can find a great 11-step guide for that <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2016/01/25/how-to-write-a-blogpost-from-your-journal-article/#author">here.</a></p>
<hr>
<h5 id="2-who-is-your-audience">2. Who is your audience?</h5>
<p>Spend some time thinking about the kind of people that you would like to reach. Is it a general audience, some more specific stakeholders (patients, professionals etc.) or businesses and policy makers?</p>
<hr>
<h5 id="3-avoid-too-much-jargon">3. Avoid (too much) jargon</h5>
<p>Keep your blog on a popular science level and avoid jargon where possible. Sure, there is no point in avoiding all relevant vocabulary or references, but you should try to make your blog accessible for a more general audience.</p>
<hr>
<h5 id="4-find-your-blogging-style-and-establish-a-routine">4. Find your blogging style and establish a routine</h5>
<p>You can write long-form essays about your research or you can write short articles about some scientific ideas. With time you will develop a style and process. Most important: you keep a routine that allows you to work fast. Writing a blog should not take much of your time. It should rather be an activity that helps you maintaining a writing routine.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="the-technical">The technical:</h1>
<p>There are many ways and platforms that can be used to publish a research-based blog. You will have to decide if you would like to establish your own web-presence or publish using an existing platform (e.g. <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>. Some popular options are:</p>
<hr>
<h5 id="wordpress">Wordpress</h5>
<p>A popular solution to host a webpage (with a blog) is Wordpress. The framework has been around for many years and will allow you to build a website in no time. There are hundreds of tutorials and guides that you can follow. You can run Wordpress installed on an own server or as a service. <a href="http://wordpress.com/">Wordpress</a> offers a free plan for a simple webpage.</p>
<hr>
<h5 id="hugo--co---static-webpages">HUGO &amp; Co - Static webpages</h5>
<p>More recently so-called static webpages have become very popular as a framework. The obvious technical advantage: webpages produced using that approach require no dedicated hosting framework – meaning that they can be hosted with minimal resources on e.g. github pages. So far, the deployment of such webpages requires some technical understanding but can be mastered rather easily. <a href="https://gohugo.io/">HUGO</a> is an open source framework to build such webpages. There are 100s of free templates for different purposes including blogs and personal academic webpages. This page for example is built using HUGO.</p>

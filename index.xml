      <description>Writing an academic blog post is a great way to disseminate your research and expand your network even more. A blog enables you to access new audiences outside your close peer-community – for instance businesses and policy makers. Like other digital academic engagement, publishing a blog will not necessarily translate into more citations for your publications but it may increase attention on your work among practitioners and may even land you invites to give keynotes or to act as a consultant outside academia.</description>

      <description>#ReachAAUt is a project at Aalborg University, Denmark running since April 2020. We started this project because there exists much important and valuable research and scholars find it often difficult to communicate their research outside established to a broader audience. As researchers we know the importance of knowledge sharing which is why we have created #ReachAAUt. With this project we want to help other researchers ensure effective research dissemination. In practice we don&amp;rsquo;t want to reinvent the wheel but to identify and promote good practice already in use.</description>
